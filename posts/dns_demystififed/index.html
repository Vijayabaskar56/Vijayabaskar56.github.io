<h1>DNS Demystified</h1>

<br/><br/>
<h1 id="dns">DNS</h1>
<p>I have recently purchased a domain and set up this blog, and while doing it, I learned how to configure domain , and then I got curious and learned more about the DNS system and how it works and its different types. so in this post I am going to Demystify the DNS system from the beginner perspective.</p>
<p>Is a Robust System that Upload the Intenet as we know, and when I learn about it , it facinate me , how to system is strucutred and designed</p>
<p>| “DNS is kind of the hamster under the hood that drives the Internet.”
- David Ulevitch</p>
<h2 id="what-is-dns">What is DNS</h2>
<p>DNS (Domain Name System) - is a system that is designed from the group of to manage the Domain of the Intenet.</p>
<p>DNS Solve the Problem of we as human with a poor memory power need to enter number of ip address for each time when we wanted to visit our faviour site</p>
<p>It Solve this using a system</p>
<p>The beauty Lies in the Brilliance of the desinged, imageing a task of designing a database that has billion and billion of entries, but still need to be quried in a nano seconds, and that were the enginnering behind the DNS design comes into play</p>
<p>they divide the searching and filtering into 3 part, and each part get you closer to you domain</p>
<h2 id="type-of-dns-records-types">Type of DNS Records Types</h2>
<h3 id="a-record-address-record">A Record (Address Record)</h3>
<p>Function: Returns a 32-bit IPv4 address. It’s commonly used to map hostnames to IP addresses.
Example: If you type “example.com” in your browser, the A record helps resolve it to an actual IP address like 192.0.2.11.</p>
<h3 id="aaaa-record-ipv6-address-record">AAAA Record (IPv6 Address Record)</h3>
<p>Function: Returns a 128-bit IPv6 address. Used to map hostnames to IPv6 addresses.
Example: Similar to A records but for IPv6 addresses.</p>
<h3 id="cname-record-canonical-name">CNAME Record (Canonical Name)</h3>
<p>Function: Creates an alias for one name to another. The DNS lookup continues by retrying with the new name.
Example: If “www” is a CNAME for “webserver,” accessing “www.example.com” will lead to “webserver.example.com.”</p>
<h3 id="ns-records-nameservers">NS Records (Nameservers)</h3>
<p>Function: Specifies the authoritative nameservers for a domain.
Example: These records point to servers where all DNS records for a domain are stored.</p>
<h3 id="mx-records-mail-exchanger">MX Records (Mail Exchanger)</h3>
<p>Function: Points a domain to email servers using SMTP.
Example: When someone sends an email to “<a href="mailto:user@example.com">user@example.com</a>,” MX records direct it to the appropriate mail server.</p>
<h3 id="txt-record">TXT Record</h3>
<p>Function: Used for various authentication methods and verifying domain ownership.
Example: Often used for SPF (Sender Policy Framework) records to prevent email spoofing.</p>
<h3 id="ptr-record-pointer">PTR Record (Pointer)</h3>
<p>Function: Used for reverse DNS lookup. Associates an IP address with its domain name.
Example: Helps verify the authenticity of an IP address.</p>
<h3 id="srv-record-service-locator">SRV Record (Service Locator)</h3>
<p>Function: Specifies the location of services (e.g., SIP, XMPP) in the network.
Example: Used for generalized service location1.</p>
