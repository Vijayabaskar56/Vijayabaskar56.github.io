      <description>Hey, It&amp;rsquo;s officially day 3 from the day I have started, and I haven&amp;rsquo;t made much progress till now, but I am determined to stick to the end. I believe every single progress counts.&#xA;So here is today&amp;rsquo;s progress: I created a mock scroll view of songs with dummy data, and I am also planning to use the Spotify Developer API to get the user&amp;rsquo;s recently listened songs and display the songs on the Home Screen so that it can be easy to add their recent favorites to the room.</description>

      <description>I am participating in the Nights and Weekends Season 5 of BuildSpace, so this blog is about:&#xA;What the heck is that? Why am I excited about it? What is the plan and other stuff. BuildSpace is a home for people bringing their wildest ideas to life, and every year they conduct an event named Nights and Weekends. The general idea behind the event is that anybody can join with an idea of their own and bring it to life over a six-week period.</description>
